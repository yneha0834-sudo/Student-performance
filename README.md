Objective:
To predict students’ exam scores using machine learning by analyzing factors like study hours,
attendance, motivation, and parental involvement.

What is the project about?
This project helps us understand how different factors affect a student’s exam marks. Using past
data, the computer learns patterns and predicts how well a student might perform in exams.

Dataset Used:
The dataset contains details such as Hours Studied, Attendance, Sleep Hours, Parental
Involvement, Internet Access, Previous Scores, and Exam Score. These features are used to                                
predict the final exam marks.

How it works:
1. Load the dataset in Python using pandas.
2. Convert text data (like Male/Female) into numbers.
3. Split the data into training and testing parts.
4. Train the model using Linear Regression.
5. Predict exam scores for new students.
6. Check the accuracy of the predictions.

Results:
The model predicts exam scores with good accuracy. Factors like study hours, attendance, and
motivation were found to have the strongest impact on marks.

Conclusion:
This project shows that student performance can be predicted using data. It helps teachers and
parents identify which areas a student needs to improve for better results.
